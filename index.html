<p>Obesity is one of the most common health complications among 
the youth. There is an overwhelming 17% of teenagers who are 
suffering from obesity in America. This is a problem because obesity
can cause many health complications in the future. A person who is 
obese has a higher chance of having heart disease, diabetes, and 
even a shorter life expectancy.</p>

<a id="mission" class="anchor" href="#mission" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mission</h1>

<p>We have dedicated an interactive app that
is able to help teenagers with their health. We do not mainly focus
on numbers, instead we try to get to know our users habits, hobbies,
and we try to create a friendly and calm environment.</p>

<h1>
<a id="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution</h1>

<p>Our interactive app has 4 main sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>the profile</li>
<li>tracker,</li>
<li>community</li>
<li>articles.</li>
</ul>

<p>The profile is the private customization corner for the user. The trackers records and
presents data such as weight, steps, and even mood. The community is the social hub for the 
user. This is where a user can connect with other users to create a safe and motivatioanl
environment. Finally, the articles provide essential information for the user to 
lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle.</p>
