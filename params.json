This is a problem because obesity\r\n        can cause many health complications in the future. A person who is \r\n        obese has a higher chance of having heart disease, diabetes, and \r\n        even a shorter life expectancy.\r\n\r\n# We have dedicated an interactive app that\r\n        is able to help teenagers with their health. We do not mainly focus\r\n        on numbers, instead we try to get to know our users habits, hobbies,\r\n        and we try to create a friendly and calm environment.\r\n\r\n# Our interactive app has 4 main sections: the profile, tracker,\r\n        community, and articles. The profile is the private custumization corner for the user. The trackers records and\r\n        presents data such as weight, steps, and even mood. The community is the social hub for the \r\n        user. This is where a user can connect with other users to create a safe and motivatioanl\r\n        environment. Finally, the articles provide essential information for the user to \r\n        lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle.",
